# SLScheevo

Achievement generator for [SLSsteam](https://github.com/AceSLS/SLSsteam), originally forked from [Detanups old GBE_Tools](https://github.com/Detanup01/gbe_fork_tools/), stripped logic and automated

## How to run:

- Remember to run in Command Prompt/Terminal! This is not a GUI application!
- Linux: [latest release](https://github.com/xamionex/SLScheevo/releases/latest/download/SLScheevo-Linux.tar.gz)
- Windows: [latest release](https://github.com/xamionex/SLScheevo/releases/latest/download/SLScheevo-Windows.zip)

## How to run from source

Requires Python3, was made with Python 3.12 but any version should theoretically work

- Linux: run.sh
- Windows: You might need to pip install -r requirements and then python SLScheevo.py
  since I'm pretty sure run.bat doesn't work because of venv environments not working on windows
  I'll gladly accept a PR if you have a solution for this
